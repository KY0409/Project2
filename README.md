# Analyzing 10Gb of Yelp Reviews Data

In this project, we are going to provision a Spark cluster on AWS EMR, connect it to a Jupyter Notebook and then run a series of queries using Pyspark based on Yelp's business, reviews and user data. This dataset uses AWS s3 bucket to load the data. The json format data is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset). The following are the steps to conduct the analysis.

## Steps

Part I: Installation and Initial Setup

Part II: Analyzing Categories (Business dataset)


how many unique categories are represented in this dataset?
What are the top 20 most popular business categories?
Part III: Do Yelp Reviews biased from the average rating? (Review dataset)

Is it true that people who write a review are those who are more dissatisfied or more satisfied with the service receivedï¼Ÿ
Part IV: Analzing Users (User dataset)

Should Elite users be trusted?
